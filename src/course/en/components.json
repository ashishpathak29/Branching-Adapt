For many, performing a challenging job can also give a great sense of achievement. </p><p>Along with these very rewarding aspects, your jobs may also be physically and emotionally demanding. For example, responding to the human costs of disasters, such as wars, floods, earthquakes, famines, or refugee crises can have a negative impact on the way you feel. Similarly, you may have to deal with longer-term issues such as poverty, hunger, and disease, as well as high workloads and insecure environments.</p><p>It’s understandable that these situations may lead to various emotions such as, feeling unhappy, tense or angry. However there are often warning signs before these emotions come to the surface. </p><p>In this course, you’ll get the chance to think through the stress that you experience as part of your job. </p><p>We’ll help you identify the warning signs to look out for in yourself and in your colleagues. </p><p>We’ll also provide you with strategies and techniques to reduce stress and help you cope with various stressful situations.</p><p>Some of the material you read during the course may trigger thoughts and personal experiences. Additional support and resources will be available throughout the course.</p><p>Let’s begin by looking at the goals we hope to help you achieve by the end of this course.</p>",

            "inlineTranscriptBody": "<p>Humanitarians work to change the lives of vulnerable people. It’s incredibly rewarding and inspiring. But, it can also be tough and challenging. In our line of work, there’s a high risk of burnout. That feeling that you&apos;re about to physically or mentally collapse due to a combination of overwork, stress and the emotional demands of your role. Everybody, even the most experienced among us, has a breaking point. Where that breaking point is and what contributes to it is different for each of us. </p><p>So, what are the causes of burnout? </p><p>Work-related stress is a key factor. In short doses, stress can be useful. It can motivate us to get work done. However, when the stress is too high or lasts too long or demands become too many or unreasonable, it can start to drain us. Feeling like you have little or no control of your work or not seeing an impact from it are also big factors. Also, being held to overly high standards with little recognition can negatively affect you.</p><p>Lifestyle factors contribute to burnout. Humanitarians often put work above all else even our own health. Being away from friends and family is part of the job and can be challenging. Sometimes you might feel like you have no one to speak with and other times like they are demanding too much from you. </p><p>What signs of burnout should you look out for? </p><p>Burnout is a gradual process that occurs over an extended period of time. The earlier you catch it, the better. Watch out for signs that you may be struggling. For example, </p><ul><li>A loss of self-confidence and not knowing what to do. </li><li>Feeling emotionally worn out with regular mood changes: irritability, tearfulness and emotional exhaustion. </li><li>Feeling detached, cut off and wondering “What’s the point anymore?” </li><li>Difficulty focusing and an inability to get a good night’s sleep. </li><li>Hiding from your problems by isolating yourself or self-medicating with alcohol or drugs. </li><li>A decline in your general health and taking longer to recover when you&apos;re sick.</li></ul><p>These are warning signs to seek support.</p><p>How can we look after ourselves?</p><p>Share your workload; delegating tasks is healthy and gives others the chance to excel. </p><p>Speak to those around you; having someone to listen to you and rely on is incredibly important for your wellbeing. Ask them to watch out for worrying changes in your behaviour. Also, check in with your line manager, if you need more support or a break, let them know. </p><p>Although, it’s not always easy, make an effort to be healthy; scheduled meal times, a balanced diet, a good night’s sleep, exercise and relaxation are all vital. There’s no shame or guilt in taking time for your own wellbeing. The healthier you are, the more good you can do for others. </p>",

It colours our choices and prevents us from being clear about what we need. Over the first few years, I gathered traumatic experiences like badges to be proud of. I lived through bombs, robberies, fighting and witnessed suffering that is unimaginable. It’s hard to know what was ‘the worst’, but there is one experience that has stayed with me.”</p>",

She would sit and stare at the wall, as would her mother. Not interacting with each other. Not moving. I was working with local counsellors and we began to ask more questions. It turned out that the girl and her mother had witnessed all of the children in her village being forced into a grass hut and burned alive by the Junjaweed (a militia group that operates in Western Sudan and Eastern Chad). We went to visit the village, saw the burned skeleton of the hut and the graves and with that came a profound feeling of hopelessness in humanity. How could a human being do this to children? For years after, I’ve thought about them. After seeing so much suffering, I feel exhausted. What is the point of doing this work, and how is what I’m doing of any help?”</p>",
