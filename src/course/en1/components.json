        "body":"<p>For many managers, working for the humanitarian sector is a positive experience. Coordinating challenging programmes can give you a great sense of achievement. The frontline teams you manage are critical in improving the lives of people in need, and this can be very fulfilling, for both you and your teams. </p><p>Along with these very rewarding aspects, you and your teams may also find physically and emotionally demanding aspects in your job. In addition, you may find that you have stress related to large workloads and challenging workplace relationships with colleagues and managers. For example, responding to the human costs of disasters, such as wars, floods, earthquakes, famines, or refugee crises can have a negative impact on the way you and your teams of humanitarian workers feel. Similarly, humanitarian workers in your organisation may have to deal with longer-term issues such as poverty, hunger and disease, as well as high workloads and insecure environments.</p><p>As a manager, it’s important to be aware of the issues faced by your team as well as dealing with organisational challenges, such as high workloads and limited resources and planning. </p><p>As well as organisation and field stressors, you and your teams will also have individual, personal-life stressors, such as family and relationship issues.</p><p>It’s understandable that these situations may make humanitarian workers feel unhappy, tense or angry. However there are things that you can do to help your teams prepare, navigate, and recover from these job hazards. </p><p>This course will get you thinking about the stress that you and your teams experience as part of your roles. </p><p>We’ll help you identify the warning signs to look out for in humanitarian workers and in your colleagues. </p><p>You’ll also find strategies and techniques to help humanitarian workers cope with various stressful situations and encourage them to play their part in managing their wellness and resilience.</p><p>We’ll also provide you with guidance on embedding a culture of wellness and resilience within your organisation.</p><p>Some of the material you read during the course may trigger thoughts and personal experiences. Additional support and resources will be available throughout the course. </p><p>Let’s begin by looking at the goals we hope to help you achieve by the end of this course.</p>",

What does being resilient mean?</p><p>It refers to our ability  to regain our positive coping strategies that may have been compromised during  times of high stress. Resilience determines how quickly we get back to our steady  state after a stressful situation has passed. It helps us to bounce back in the  face of adversity.</p><p>It is easier to  observe the effects of resilience than to define what makes a person resilient.  Like intelligence or personality, resilience is a complex construct and it may  look different for people in various contexts. It may even change for you at different  points in your life. Some of the core components of resilience include having  reasons for hope and optimism, meaning and purpose, a willingness to engage  challenges, and a strong network of social support.</p>",

            "inlineTranscriptBody": "<p>Humanitarians work to change the lives of vulnerable people. It’s incredibly rewarding and inspiring. But, it can also be tough and challenging. In our line of work, there’s a high risk of burnout. That feeling that you&apos;re about to physically or mentally collapse due to a combination of overwork, stress and the emotional demands of your role. Everybody, even the most experienced among us, has a breaking point. Where that breaking point is and what contributes to it is different for each of us. </p><p>So, what are the causes of burnout? </p><p>Work-related stress is a key factor. In short doses, stress can be useful. It can motivate us to get work done. However, when the stress is too high or lasts too long or demands become too many or unreasonable, it can start to drain us. Feeling like you have little or no control of your work or not seeing an impact from it are also big factors. Also, being held to overly high standards with little recognition can negatively affect you.</p><p>Lifestyle factors contribute to burnout. Humanitarians often put work above all else even our own health. Being away from friends and family is part of the job and can be challenging. Sometimes you might feel like you have no one to speak with and other times like they are demanding too much from you. </p><p>What signs of burnout should you look out for? </p><p>Burnout is a gradual process that occurs over an extended period of time. The earlier you catch it, the better. Watch out for signs that you may be struggling. For example, </p><ul><li>A loss of self-confidence and not knowing what to do. </li><li>Feeling emotionally worn out with regular mood changes: irritability, tearfulness and emotional exhaustion. </li><li>Feeling detached, cut off and wondering “What’s the point anymore?” </li><li>Difficulty focusing and an inability to get a good night’s sleep. </li><li>Hiding from your problems by isolating yourself or self-medicating with alcohol or drugs. </li><li>A decline in your general health and taking longer to recover when you&apos;re sick.</li></ul><p>These are warning signs to seek support.</p><p>How can we look after ourselves?</p><p>Share your workload; delegating tasks is healthy and gives others the chance to excel. </p><p>Speak to those around you; having someone to listen to you and rely on is incredibly important for your wellbeing. Ask them to watch out for worrying changes in your behaviour. Also, check in with your line manager, if you need more support or a break, let them know. </p><p>Although, it’s not always easy, make an effort to be healthy; scheduled meal times, a balanced diet, a good night’s sleep, exercise and relaxation are all vital. There’s no shame or guilt in taking time for your own wellbeing. The healthier you are, the more good you can do for others. </p>",

It colours our choices and prevents us from being clear about what we need. Over the first few years, I gathered traumatic experiences like badges to be proud of. I lived through bombs, robberies, fighting and witnessed suffering that is unimaginable. It’s hard to know what was ‘the worst’, but there is one experience that has stayed with me.”</p>",

It turned out that the girl and her mother had witnessed all of the children in her village being forced into a grass hut and burned alive by the Junjaweed (a militia group that operates in Western Sudan and Eastern Chad). We went to visit the village, saw the burned skeleton of the hut and the graves and with that came a profound feeling of hopelessness in humanity. How could a human being do this to children? For years after, I’ve thought about them. After seeing so much suffering, I feel exhausted. What is the point of doing this work, and how is what I’m doing of any help?”</p>",

Some see it as a state of fulfilment, feeling whole…. Others describe it as their body, mind and spirit being at ease….</p><p>It might be described as having a good balance between personal and professional  life… Or being able to manage the ups and downs of life. Wellbeing is not just about how to recover from stress or burnt out, it’s also about building resilience to the challenges we might face. It isn’t something we either have or don’t have – Resilience can be developed.</p><p>If we can build the resilience of our teams then we reduce stress and burnout. Staff turnover goes down, and our ability to help the communities we are working with increases.</p><p>Not everyone sees the importance of wellbeing: Some might say ‘This is an emergency, we don’t have time for this kind of stuff’ or ‘If you are not tough enough, perhaps you shouldn’t be working in emergency response’. Another reaction might be ‘It’s not my job as a field manager to look after my team. I am there to get the job done.</p><p>Perhaps you have had these doubts? But think about it:</p><p>The situations we are working in are outside of most people’s day to day experiences. As managers, we have a duty of care to our staff and ourselves. We can’t meet the needs of those affected by the emergency if we are, ourselves, stressed or burnt out.</p><p>You might ask…‘But how can I make a difference?’ Firstly, Recognise the different health and wellbeing challenges that staff face. Then create a healthy working environment that nurtures resilience. Identify techniques that help build resilience and adopt them within your team…and recognise and monitor signs of stress in yourself and the people you manage.</p><p>Remember, stress can be influenced by many factors including culture, length of assignment and gender expectations – don’t treat all situations the same. By looking after the wellbeing of yourself and your team, you make a real impact on the communities you are there to support. Everyone benefits.</p>",
